Task 12.1.

Instruction 1. Create the protocol "ComplexNumber" that includes two properties: "re" (the real part of the number) and "im" (the imaginary part of the number).
Instruction 2. Create a class "ComplexNumberOperations" that implements addition of two numbers, subtraction of two numbers, and displaying a complex number. The class must adopt the defined protocol.

Task 12.2.

Instruction 1. Create the protocol "RandomNumber" that includes a function "generateNumber()" returning a random integer.
Instruction 2. Create a class "Numbers" that adopts the defined protocol, containing 2 integers. The class should have functions such as displaying 2 numbers and raising a number to the power defined as a parameter.
Instruction 3. Test the created functions.

Task 12.3.

Instruction 1. Define an enumeration type to handle errors related to division by 0 and calculating the square root of a non-positive number.
Instruction 2. Create a function that triggers the appropriate errors.
Instruction 3. Handle errors using do-catch statements.
Instruction 4. Create a program that performs the operation of dividing two integers and calculating the square root.

Task 12.4.

Instruction 1. Define an enumeration type to handle errors during ATM cash withdrawal: insufficient funds, lack of amount in the ATM, exceeding the daily limit, inability to withdraw the amount (lack of denominations), and other errors (e.g., incorrect amount).
Instruction 2. Create a function that triggers the appropriate errors.
Instruction 3. Handle errors using do-catch statements.
Instruction 4. Create a program that prompts the user for the amount to withdraw from the ATM and displays information about the successfully completed operation or the encountered error. The ATM amount and denominations can be defined as constants in the program.
